Anand Geete of the Sena, who was inducted as heavy industries minister when Modi formed his Cabinet in May this year, has been summoned back to Mumbai, reinforcing the impression that there might be trouble ahead. Geete was scheduled to meet the PM on Saturday but confirmed that the meeting did not take place.

Uddhav said that he would spell out his stand on whether to join the BJP government in Maharashtra and whether to nominate one Sena minister for the Union Cabinet after a party MLAs' meeting on Sunday. The Sena meeting, however, is in the evening, while the Union Cabinet expansion is scheduled to take place in the afternoon.

Sources said Uddhav had earlier recommended party Rajya Sabha MP Anil Desai's name for inclusion in the Union Cabinet.
