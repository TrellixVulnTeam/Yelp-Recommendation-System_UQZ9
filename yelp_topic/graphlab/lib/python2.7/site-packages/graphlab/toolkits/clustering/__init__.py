"""
The GraphLab clustering toolkit provides tools for unsupervised learning
problems, where the aim is to consolidate unlabeled data points into groups
based on how similar the points are to each other.

Presently, this toolkit contains only the k-means++ algorithm.

Please see the :py:class:`~graphlab.kmeans.KMeansModel`, as well as the data
science `Gallery <http://www.graphlab.com/learn/gallery>`_ and the `clustering
chapter of the User Guide
<http://www.graphlab.com/learn/userguide/index.html#Modeling_data_Clustering_and_nearest_neighbors>`_ 
for more details and examples.
